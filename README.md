Overview
This folder includes the climate datasets (historical/projection) and visualization for the 71 DOE-LM sites identified through the LM Site Questionnaire that were deemed to have some level of potential risk associated with future climate change in terms of altering system performance and/or exceeding design requirements. We use the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) climate models (Taylor et al., 2012), which are the standard global climate model ensembles used in the US Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both historical and future projection datasets (Thrasher et al., 2012) are downscaled to 28 km (0.25 degree) from the coarser 1-degree resolution GCM output.
